This program consists of three files namely c.java,rs.java,ls.java


c.java-> It is a client side program .

ls.java-> It is a local server side program.

rs.java-> It is a root server side program.

Implementation:

then ls.java

then rs.java


Working:

Here c.java will given with the domain name as input and it will now search the domain name in local server (local.txt) if the domain name is not found in local server
then it will move towards the root server (root.txt) where the domain name is available along with its IP address. and finally it gets printed.
